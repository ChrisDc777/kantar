Do you like slowed + reverb music or maybe nightcore? Well, then, this app is certainly to be up your street then.

Kantar is a melancholy music app, which lets you modify whatever you listen to such that it flows with moods. It uses the Tone.js (AudioContext API) in doing real-time manipulation on audio.
